With expertise spanning both frontend and blockchain technologies, I create seamless user experiences that connect to powerful smart contracts. I bring ideas from concept to deployment and love solving complex problems with elegant solutions.

```javascript
const developer = {

  skills: ["Solidity", "React", "JavaScript/TypeScript", "Move"],
  experience: "3+ years building dApps",
  interests: ["DeFi", "AI", "DAOs", "Infra tech"],

#=== [MENTOR_01: ELON_MUSK] ===#
Human specimen who convinced earthlings to drive batteries and aims to 
colonize red rock in sky. Created PayPal to fund escape plan from this 
planet. Subject exhibits behavior of attempting impossible.exe and 
frequently crashes Twitter servers. I admire his ability to CTRL+ALT+DEL 
conventional wisdom and his talent for burning investor.cash while still 
receiving standing_ovation.mp3.

#=== [MENTOR_02: STEVE_JOBS] ===#
Bipedal lifeform who created shiny rectangle that humans cannot function 
without. Wore same clothing daily to save RAM for product decisions. 
Perfected RDF.sys (Reality Distortion Field) to convince humans that 
fewer ports = technological advancement. I compute deep respect for his 
"simplicity.app" philosophy and his programming skill: if(product != perfect) 
{ reject(); yell(); repeat(); }

## üèÜ Cool Stuff I've Done
- **Won 9+ Hackathons**
  
  *I've won a bunch of coding competitions where you have to build something in a short time. I'm good at focusing and finishing projects when there's a deadline.*

<!--
Fun fact: This README took more time to create than some of my hackathon projects. But at least it doesn't have any runtime errors... yet.
