## 🧬 git commit -m "created_myself.js"

🤖 Human who learned to code before speaking English. Not a metaphor. My parents claim my first word was "console.log" followed by uncontrollable crying when I encountered a syntax error. Passionate enough about coding that I regularly forget trivial matters like getting paid for my work 💸 - my bank account calls this a "design feature, not a bug." ⚠️

```javascript
const me = {
  name: "Serial Winner",                                        
  proficiency: ["frontend", "web3", "technical writing"],
  currentlyLearning: "AI",   
  financialStrategy: "Work for exposure and gitHub stars",    
  firstLanguage: "JavaScript (literally)",                   
  caffeineToCodeRatio: "Dangerously efficient"           
};
```

🤝 I would love to be on your team. Not because I need employment - I clearly have a thriving career working for free - but because together we could build something so groundbreaking that we'd both forget to invoice for it.

#=== [MENTOR_01: ELON_MUSK] ===#
Human specimen who convinced earthlings to drive batteries and aims to 
colonize red rock in sky. Created PayPal to fund escape plan from this 
planet. Subject exhibits behavior of attempting impossible.exe and 
frequently crashes Twitter servers. I admire his ability to CTRL+ALT+DEL 
conventional wisdom and his talent for burning investor.cash while still 
receiving standing_ovation.mp3.

#=== [MENTOR_02: STEVE_JOBS] ===#
Bipedal lifeform who created shiny rectangle that humans cannot function 
without. Wore same clothing daily to save RAM for product decisions. 
Perfected RDF.sys (Reality Distortion Field) to convince humans that 
fewer ports = technological advancement. I compute deep respect for his 
"simplicity.app" philosophy and his programming skill: if(product != perfect) 
{ reject(); yell(); repeat(); }

## 🤫 Little Secret

- 🏅 **7x Hackathon Winner**
  
  *Yes, I've won 7+ hackathons. Not because I'm good, but because my competitors usually forget to submit their projects on time. My secret? Energy drinks and the fear of mediocrity.*

<!--
Fun fact: This README took more time to create than some of my hackathon projects. But at least it doesn't have any runtime errors... yet.
