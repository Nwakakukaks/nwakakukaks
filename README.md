## 🧬 git commit -m "created_myself.js"

🤖 Human who learned to code before speaking English. Not a metaphor. My parents claim my first word was "console.log" followed by uncontrollable crying when I encountered a syntax error. Passionate enough about coding that I regularly forget trivial matters like getting paid for my work 💸 - my bank account calls this a "design feature, not a bug." ⚠️

```javascript
const me = {
  name: "Serial Winner",                                        
  proficiency: ["frontend", "web3", "technical writing"],
  currentlyLearning: "AI",   
  financialStrategy: "Work for exposure and gitHub stars",    
  firstLanguage: "JavaScript (literally)",                   
  caffeineToCodeRatio: "Dangerously efficient"           
};
```

🤝 I would love to be on your team. Not because I need employment - I clearly have a thriving career working for free - but because together we could build something so groundbreaking that we'd both forget to invoice for it.

## 🤫 Little Secret

- 🏅 **7x Hackathon Winner**
  
  *Yes, I've won 7+ hackathons. Not because I'm good, but because my competitors usually forget to submit their projects on time. My secret? Energy drinks and the fear of mediocrity.*

<!--
Fun fact: This README took more time to create than some of my hackathon projects. But at least it doesn't have any runtime errors... yet.
